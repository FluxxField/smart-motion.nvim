# Actions

Actions are the **final stage** of a SmartMotion pipeline. Once a user selects a target, the action defines **what happens** â€” like jumping, deleting, yanking, changing, or anything else you want.

> [!TIP]
> If extractors define _what_, filters define _which_, and visualizers show _how_ â€” actions define _why_. They are the result.

## âœ… What an Action Does

An action receives the final selected target and executes logic. This might be:

- Jumping the cursor to the target
- Deleting from the current cursor to the target
- Yanking or changing text
- Opening a floating window or performing diagnostics

Actions are **completely open-ended**. You control the behavior.

## ðŸ“¦ Built-in Actions

| Name            | Description                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jump`          | Moves cursor to the target's position                                     |
| `delete`        | Deletes text from current cursor to target                                |
| `delete_jump`   | Jumps to the target and deletes from there                                |
| `delete_until`  | Deletes up to (but not including) the target column                       |
| `yank`          | Yanks from current position to the target                                 |
| `yank_jump`     | Jumps to the target and yanks from there                                  |
| `yank_until`    | Yanks up to (but not including) the target column                         |
| `remote_delete` | Deletes the target without moving the cursor                              |
| `remote_yank`   | Yanks the target without moving the cursor                                |
| `change`        | Deletes text from the current cursor to the target and enters insert mode |
| `change_jump`   | Jumps to the target and deletes, and enters insert mode from there        |
| `change_until`  | Change up to (but not including) the target                               |

## ðŸ”€ Action Merging

SmartMotion includes a utility to **merge multiple actions** into a single one. This is how motions like `dw` are possible:

```lua
local merge = require("smart-motion.core.utils").action_utils.merge

local motion = {
  action = merge({ "jump", "delete" })
}
```

This will:

1. Move the cursor to the target (`jump`)
2. Then apply `delete` from the new position

You can merge any number of built-in or custom actions â€” theyâ€™ll execute in order.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is key for supporting native-feeling motions like `dw`, `ct)`, etc.

## âœ¨ Example: Jump Action

```lua
---@type SmartMotionActionModule
local M = {}

function M.run(ctx, cfg, motion_state)
  local jump_target = motion_state.selected_jump_target

  if type(jump_target) ~= "table" or not jump_target.row or not jump_target.col then
    return
  end

  if jump_target.bufnr ~= vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf() then
    vim.api.nvim_set_current_buf(jump_target.bufnr)
  end

  local pos = { jump_target.row + 1, jump_target.col }
  local success, err = pcall(vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor, jump_target.winid or 0, pos)

  if not success then
    -- Log an error
  end
end

return M
```

Register it:

```lua
require("smart-motion.core.registries")
  :get().actions.register("my_jump", M)
```

## ðŸ›  Custom Actions Ideas

- Open diagnostics at the target location
- Refactor symbol under the cursor
- Copy to system clipboard
- Log to a side panel
- Center screen on target + reveal extra context

---

## ðŸ”® Future Possibilities

- Undo checkpoints before composite actions
- Named action chains with conditions
- Visual feedback preview on hover (via visualizer/action hybrid)
