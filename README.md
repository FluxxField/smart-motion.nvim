# SmartMotion.nvim - Home-row powered smart motions for Neovim

## üìñ What is SmartMotion?

`SmartMotion.nvim` is a motion plugin for Neovim that brings **intuitive, home-row driven navigation** to your code. Forget counting words or characters ‚Äî SmartMotion instantly highlights jump targets **with dynamic, in-place labels**, allowing you to navigate faster and more naturally.

SmartMotion is part of my personal War on Counting. I believe motions in Neovim should be about intent, not arithmetic. Why count words, characters, or lines when your editor can show you the way? This philosophy drives not only word motions, but my future plans to enhance commands like dt and ct ‚Äî so instead of typing dt; or dt) and mentally counting, you just jump directly to the desired target.

---

## üöÄ Why SmartMotion? (What Makes Us Different)

SmartMotion takes the **best ideas from plugins like Hop.nvim and EasyMotion**, and layers on:

- üî¶ **Smart Label Generation:** Dynamically chooses between single-character and double-character labels based on target density.
- üî¶ **Dynamic Highlight Feedback:** After selecting the first character in a double hint, SmartMotion dims the first and highlights the second.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Zero Default Mappings:** You control how and when SmartMotion activates ‚Äî no keybinding conflicts.
- üîÑ **Expandable Architecture:** Currently being built to support future motions like `f`, `t`, paragraph, line, and operator motions.

## üí≥ Installation

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
    "FluxxField/smart-motion.nvim",
    config = function()
        require("smart-motion").setup()
    end
}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

```lua
require("smart-motion").setup({
    keys = "fjdksleirughtynm",
    highlight = {
        dim = "SmartMotionDim",
        hint = "SmartMotionHint",
        first_char = "SmartMotionFirstChar",
        second_char = "SmartMotionSecondChar",
        first_char_dim = "SmartMotionFirstCharDim",
    },
})
```

---

## üîπ Important Callout: No Default Mappings

SmartMotion does not register any mappings by default. You must define your own. Example:

```lua
return {
  "FluxxField/smart-motion.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  config = function()
    local smart_motion = require "smart-motion"
    local DIRECTION = smart_motion.consts.DIRECTION
    local HINT_POSITION = smart_motion.consts.HINT_POSITION

    smart_motion.setup {
      mappings = {
        n = {
          w = {
            function() require("smart-motion").hint_words(DIRECTION.AFTER_CURSOR, HINT_POSITION.START, true) end,
            desc = "smart-motion forward word",
          },
          b = {
            function() require("smart-motion").hint_words(DIRECTION.BEFORE_CURSOR, HINT_POSITION.START, true) end,
            desc = "smart-motion backward word",
          },
          e = {
            function() require("smart-motion").hint_words(DIRECTION.AFTER_CURSOR, HINT_POSITION.END, true) end,
            desc = "smart-motion forward to word end",
          },
          ge = {
            function() require("smart-motion").hint_words(DIRECTION.BEFORE_CURSOR, HINT_POSITION.END, true) end,
            desc = "smart-motion backward to word end",
          },
        },
        v = {},
      },
    }
  end,
}
```

üé® Important Callout: Flexible Highlight Configuration

You can configure how SmartMotion highlights its hints in two ways:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Reference Existing Highlight Groups (Default)

This is the easiest way ‚Äî you can point to existing highlight groups (like SmartMotionHint).

```lua
highlight = {
    dim = "SmartMotionDim",
    hint = "SmartMotionHint",
    first_char = "SmartMotionFirstChar",
    second_char = "SmartMotionSecondChar",
    first_char_dim = "SmartMotionFirstCharDim",
}
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Directly Define Colors (Power User Option)

You can also pass highlight definitions directly if you want full control.

```lua
highlight = {
    dim = { fg = "#5C6370", bg = "none" },
    hint = { fg = "#E06C75", bg = "none" },
    first_char = { fg = "#98C379", bg = "none" },
    second_char = { fg = "#61AFEF", bg = "none" },
    first_char_dim = { fg = "#6F8D57", bg = "none" },
}
```

This makes SmartMotion extremely flexible and allows it to seamlessly fit into any colorscheme.
